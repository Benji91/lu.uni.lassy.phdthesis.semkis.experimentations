# SEMKIS: Software engineering methodology for the knowledge management of intelligent Systems
## Experimentations and User manual of the SEMKIS iterative process
## 1. Project repository informations

SEMKIS is a software engineering methodology for supporting software engineers to engineer deep learning datasets for developing improved neural networks (NN).
We want to support NN software engineers with the software engineering principles in order to produce high-quality neural networks.
Therefore, we introduce an iterative business process supporting the improvement of neural networks via dataset augmentation.
The datasets are engineered based on the customer's requirements and the neural network's recognition skills (key-properties) acquired during the training.


This GIT repository contains the experimentations of the SEMKIS process from my PhD thesis presenting the SEMKIS methodology.
It contains a concrete experimentation of our process focusing on the development of datasets and a neural network for two different case studies, the MNIST (recognition of handwritten digits) and meter counter (recognition of the meter counter state) case studies.
